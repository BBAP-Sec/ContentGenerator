# Content Generator

![Workflow Preview](./ContentGen.png)


## Overview

**DevOps LinkedIn Content Generator** is an automated workflow built with **n8n** that helps you create engaging, relevant, and high-quality LinkedIn posts in seconds. Now enhanced with **AI-powered image generation** and advanced diversification techniques, it ensures your content is not only impactful but also uniquely fresh every time.

Although itâ€™s designed with DevOps professionals in mind, **you can easily adapt it to generate content for *any* topic** â€” whether itâ€™s cloud, AI, project management, or personal branding.

## How It Works

1.  **Trigger**
      * The workflow can be started in two ways:
          * **Chat Trigger**: Send a message to the connected chat bot to specify a custom topic.
          * **Schedule Trigger**: It can run automatically at a set time each day using the schedule node.
2.  **Keyword Extraction**
      * It sends the topic to Google Autocomplete to fetch real-time keyword suggestions.
3.  **Dynamic Content & Style Selection**
      * A custom "Code" node acts as a **randomizer**, picking a unique writing style or specific focus for the day's posts. This ensures diverse tones and structures, avoiding repetition.
4.  **Content Generation**
      * It passes the keywords and the selected dynamic style to Google Gemini to generate **four distinct and unique LinkedIn post drafts**, each crafted with a different angle or persona.
5.  **AI Image Generation**
      * Using an external AI image generation service, the workflow creates a custom image that visually complements the generated post content and its unique daily style.
6.  **Delivery**
      * The posts and their accompanying images are automatically sent to your Telegram chat for quick review and sharing.

## Changing the Topic

âœ… **Use the Chat Box**

  * If you want a topic other than **DevOps**, just send a custom message to the chatbot (the **When chat message received** trigger in the workflow).
  * Whatever you type will replace the default topic and fetch keywords based on your input.

âœ… **Change the Default Topic**

  * If you want to change the default topic that runs on schedule:
    1.  Open the workflow in **n8n**.
    2.  Find the node named **Edit Fields2** â€” here, the `topic` parameter is set to `"devops"` by default.
    3.  Change `"devops"` to whatever topic you like, e.g., `"AI trends"`, `"Cloud Security"`, `"Productivity Hacks"` â€” anything\!

## Customizing the Prompts

âœ… If you want to modify the style, length, or tone of the generated posts or images:

  * **Diverse Post Prompts**: Look for the nodes named **HTTP Request1**, **HTTP Request2**, **HTTP Request3**, and **HTTP Request4**. Each of these nodes sends a different base prompt template to Gemini, which you can edit in the **jsonBody** to adjust word count, tone, structure, or other specific instructions.
  * **Random Style Selector**: For even greater variety, adjust the `promptStyles` array within the **Random Post Style Selector** (Code node). Add more descriptive phrases or instructions to further diversify the daily output.
  * **Image Generation Prompt**: Find the **HTTP Request** node responsible for image generation (e.g., `HTTP Request5`). You can modify its `jsonBody` to alter the style, aspect ratio, or specific elements of the generated images, often by injecting the `randomPromptStyle` for alignment with the post.

## Requirements

  * [n8n](https://n8n.io/) running locally or on your server
  * A valid Google Generative Language API key (for Gemini text generation)
  * Access to a **free AI image generation API** (e.g., Hugging Face Inference API, or free tiers of platforms like Leonardo.AI) and its API key.
  * A Telegram bot and its API token connected to your Telegram account
  * Basic understanding of editing nodes in n8n
